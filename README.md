# this is forOM

### our story
The world of social media is a bit cluttered. A bit noisy. A bit harsh.

Reddit has passion, but rack a disciprine.
Twitter and Instagram, for all their elegant style, are awash in vapid vanity.
Meanwhile, some of our best thoughts remain hidden for years, too shy to be seen or heard.

### enter forOM
forOM is a new attempt at an old ideal: the Forum of the Republic. What does this mean?

## join the conversation

forOM is intended as a simple **platform for the people**, from world leaders to community volunteers,
CEOs to custodians, grandparents to kids, to voice the **ideas and concerns** that matter most today.

forOM is about coming together, as corny as that sounds. When we listen before speaking, we make more connections.
When we limit our words, we have to focus on what's most important. We have to find common ground,
and sometimes we have to make it.

forOM is for college and shul, for church and state, for apple pie and ice cream, for me and you.
